# #whoami 

My name is Hugo Deiró and I'm a Software Engineer that ❤️ to 👀 users in the real world being impacted by something I've worked with.

For fun, I like to 📺 Anime, TV Shows and some movies. Also like to 🎮 some Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC. I like Magic the Gathering more than I should and I'm addicted on telling bad/dad jokes ([It's on my CV](https://hugodeiro.com/resume.html), seriously).

# #work

I'm currently 🧑‍💻 at [Uber](https://uber.com/) as a Software Engineer L4 on the Uber Eats project.

# #school

I have a master degree in Software and Product Engineering at the [Federal Institute of Bahia](https://portal.ifba.edu.br/), on [PPGESP](https://ppgesp.ifba.edu.br/) Program. There I've studied a lot about Data Visualization and worked on the creation of the first version of the [Visualize Your Region (VYR)](https://github.com/visualize-your-region) project.

During the school time I was kinda nerdy 🤓 and got involved in many research areas like Teaching Learning Methodologies, Human-Computer Interaction, Decision SUpport Analysis Software, Augmented Reality & others. Quite random, uh?
